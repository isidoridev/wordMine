<h1>Mine words in a text file</h1>

The goal of this project is:
Take a file with words,
Add the words into a list,
and count their occurrence in the list.

By analyzing the frequencies,
we can see popular words.
This can be used by many,
either increasing vocab in
a new language or for
skimming information.

If one understands all of the unique words,
hypothetically you should be able to have
a superficial understanding of the text.

<h3>Possible Improvements</h3>
There are two methods if you want super
optimization, one for small and one for large. 
And there should be an option for 
"the noun".

0) Open & convert from pdf to txt
1) Parse the text file (TICK)
	1.5) Clean up the text file (TICK)
2) Add each word to a list (TICK)
3) counts  = collections.Counter(wordlist) returns the frequencys (TICK)

Still a slight bug with some symbols.
Im sure it could use less looping.
Pretty sure the badchars list doesn't work.
